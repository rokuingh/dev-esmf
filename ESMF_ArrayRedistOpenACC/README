ESMF_HelloWorld                     README
---------------                     ------

This directory contains code that is based on the ESMF Fortran API.

This application runs a simplified version of the ESMF_ArrayRedistOpenMPP
system test as an external user application.


NOTE:
The executable should be run according to the system-specific procedures that
apply to the execution of binaries. The correct procedure may depend on whether
the executable was built against an mpiuni- or mpi-based ESMF library
installation.
