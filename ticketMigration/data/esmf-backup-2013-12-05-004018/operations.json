They then create a content-type\r\nand put this in the header of the email.\r\n\r\nb\\) mailman determines the extension of an archived\r\nattachment by first guessing and then comparing this guess\r\nwith what the content-type is. If they do not match, the\r\nscrubber.py in mailman goes with its guess which may be\r\nwrong. This is to protect against viruses and such. \r\n\r\nc\\) there was a bug in mailman that to the extensions of \r\nMS documents and made them gibberish. A patch was released\r\nbut other people were getting this .obj distinctions.\r\n\r\nd\\) thunderbird looks at mimeTypes.rdf for downloads and\r\nupload extensions. Sometimes the user's version of this file\r\ncan get goofed up. In my case it has not been modified from\r\nthe system default and there for that should not be an issue.\r\n\r\ne\\) Some tests:\r\nmac/thunderbird   mac/macmail  linux   windows\r\n\r\n.xls           fail          fail       pass     pass\r\n\r\n.rtf                     all pass\r\n\r\n.pdf                     all pass\r\n\r\n.doc          pass           fall       pass     pass\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nd\\) Greg woods reported that he scanned other archives for\r\nsimiliar MS -&gt; .obj issues and found many other archives\r\nthat have similiar problems. I am going to find the owners \r\nof these list and find out what platforms they are on. \r\n\r\ne\\) someone out on the ether recommended the following fix:\r\nchange the line:\r\nfilebase, ignore = os.path.splitext\\(filename\\)\r\nto:\r\nfilebase, ext = os.path.splitext\\(filename\\)\r\n\r\ngreg woods is hesitant to do this but is willing to test it\r\nunder some controled circumstances.",

They asked me to submit an extraview\r\nticket so that the powers that be can argue over who should\r\ndo it. This is the text of my ticket:\r\n\r\nESMI has numerous mailing lists that are archived. There is\r\nno search mechanism for these archives. Because of this, we\r\nduplicate\r\nthe archives on SourceForge where they can be searched. SF\r\ndoes not allow the archiving of attachments, however, so\r\nthis forces\r\nus to duplicate effort and maintain two archives. This is a\r\nproductivity sink. \r\n\r\nTwo other groups, NCL, and Marla's section use hypermail to\r\ncreate their own searchable archives. The program is\r\nimplemented separately and is manually controlled. This\r\nseems wasteful. We need an organization-wide ability to\r\nsearch mail archives.  This\r\nshould be automated. \r\n\r\nSome archives e.g. CSAC need to remain private however so\r\nsome mechanism to distinguish the two is required. \r\n\r\nWe do not care what search engine is employed.\r\n\r\nThis is a key issue for our group which includes the folks\r\nhere at NCAR, our other members at several locations around\r\nthe US, and\r\nour funders, NASA and NOAA, so the priority is relatively\r\nhigh for us. We would rather not implement our own version\r\nof hypermail or \r\nmonArch to do this and perpetuate simultaneous solutions. \r\n",

The problem is\r\nthat Mailman stores all attachments in the archives too,\r\nincluding for lists that don't have archiving turned on.

Somehow I will need to\r\ndetermine which lists have public archiving turned on and\r\ncopy only those directories. That implies some database\r\nlookups \\(and some knowledge of Mailman internals that I\r\ncurrently lack so that I will know what to look up\\),\r\nwhich immediately makes the project 10 times bigger than  a\r\nsimple rsync of a directory tree.",

I\r\nwill grant that\r\nsearching on lists with very short names is difficult\r\nbecause you get a\r\nlot of hits that have nothing to do with our lists, but I\r\ncan search the\r\nesmf\\_support archives pretty effectively right now by typing\r\n\"esmf\\_support\" followed by other search terms into Google.\r\nWhat exactly\r\nis needed that can't already be done this way, and will WEG\r\nimplementing\r\nGoogle searching locally provide it?\r\n\r\nThis came up because of yet another ethics issue. Namely, a\r\nnumber of\r\nmailman lists do have public archives, but they're not\r\nadvertised lists.\r\nThat means, if you know the list is there, you can already\r\nget to the\r\narchives even if you're not a subscriber \\(example: cdp,\r\ncosmicdiscussion\\), but those lists are not currently\r\nfindable through\r\nGoogle \\(may need some help from some of you web experts to\r\nconfirm\r\nthis\\). This means archives for these lists cannot be made\r\npublicly\r\navailable either. This will even further complicate creating\r\na list of\r\nlists to put into the search engine. This is turning into a\r\ngiant rat\r\nhole and I at least want to make sure it is really necessary\r\nbefore\r\ncrawling down it.\r\n\r\n\\--Greg\r\n\r\nSylvia,\r\n\r\nIt appears Greg is right. Google is already indexing all the\r\nESMF public Mailman archives. When I tested an archive, I\r\nwent into the WORD list which is limited to members. When I\r\nsaw the auth come up, I just figured that was happening for\r\nall Mailman lists, but I now realize yours are wide open and\r\nare being indexed by Google.\r\n\r\nSo, it appears, your needs are already being met without any\r\naction on our part. You can even construct a Google search\r\nform that limits your search results to\r\nste:mailman.ucar.edu. For more info see our Google search\r\ndocumentation page.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cisl.ucar.edu/weg/services/search.shtml\r\n\r\nLet me know if we can close the ticket.\r\n\r\nMarkus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI tested this and we were only getting a small subset of\r\nmessages from google. Markus then replied:\r\n\r\nSylvia,\r\n\r\nTry doing the \"esmf\\_support sujay\" search from the search\r\nform at the top of the www.ucar.edu page. I see 183 results.\r\n\r\nIf you do the same search at google.com, you get 211 results\r\nbut it only shows 4 results due to Google's algorithm that\r\nomits very similar entries.\r\n\r\nI am still pretty confident that Google is indexing all your\r\nlists fully.\r\n\r\nMarkus\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd \\(surprise surprise\\), if I grep -i for sujay in all of\r\nthe html files\r\nin the esmf\\_support archive and print out the file names\r\nthat match,\r\nthere are exactly 211 of them.\r\n\r\n\\--Greg\r\n\r\n\r\nI went to the ucar web site and type esmf\\_support sujay into\r\nthe box and got a slew of reponses.\r\n\r\nSo, C would you test this out and see if that meets your needs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I am also going send this report to greg.\r\n\r\nMail Archiving tests:\r\n\r\ndefinitions:\r\n\r\nPassed: The attachment exists and has the correct extension.\r\n\r\nPotential variables:\r\n\r\na\\) mailman user configuration\r\nb\\) mailman system configuration\r\nc\\) mailman version\r\nd\\) sender operating system\r\ne\\) sender mail client\r\n\r\nhard to eliminate all these variables to test appropriately.\r\n\r\n\r\nInitial  tests sent to esmf\\_core\r\n\r\n27 Sep\r\nfrom Sylvia\r\nhttp://mailman.ucar.edu/mailman/private/esmf\\_core/2006-September/001284.html\r\nsystem: Mac powerbook G4 using thunderbird\r\nfile: .xls\r\nstatus: partial failure. extension changed to .obj\r\n\r\n27 Sep\r\nfrom Sylvia\r\nhttp://mailman.ucar.edu/mailman/private/esmf\\_core/2006-September/001285.html\r\nsystem: Mac powerbook G4 using thunderbird\r\nfile: .rtf\r\nstatus: passed\r\n\r\n27 Sep\r\nfrom Sylvia\r\nhttp://mailman.ucar.edu/mailman/private/esmf\\_core/2006-September/001285.html\r\nsystem: Mac powerbook G4 using thunderbird\r\nfile: .pdf\r\nstatus: passed\r\n\r\n\r\nGreg, Sylvia,  Cecelia and Silverio continue tests to test@ucar.edu to see if our mailing list configuration is the issue\r\n\r\n28 Sep\r\nfrom Sylvia\r\nhttp://mailman.ucar.edu/pipermail/test/2006-September/000035.html\r\nsystem: Mac powerbook G4 using thunderbird\r\nfile: xcel\r\nstatus: partial fail. attachment extension is .obj\r\n\r\n28 Sep\r\nfrom Greg\r\nhttp://mailman.ucar.edu/pipermail/test/2006-September/000036.html\r\nsystem: ??\r\nfile: same xcel file as above\r\nstatus: passed\r\ncomment: this message was held for moderator approval\r\n\r\n\r\n28 Sep\r\nfrom Greg\r\nhttp://mailman.ucar.edu/pipermail/test/2006-September/000037.html\r\nsystem: ??\r\nfile: same xcel file as above\r\nstatus: passed\r\ncomment: same as above w/o moderator approval\r\n\r\n28 Sep\r\nfrom Greg\r\nhttp://mailman.ucar.edu/pipermail/test/2006-September/000038.html\r\nsystem: thunderbird on linux\r\nfile: same xcel file as above\r\nstatus: passed\r\ncomment: change operating system and mail client\r\n\r\n28 Sep\r\nfrom Sylvia\r\nhttp://mailman.ucar.edu/pipermail/test/2006-September/000039.html\r\nsystem: thunderbird on mac\r\nfile: .doc\r\nstatus: passed\r\ncomment: since excel files fail when sent by sylvia to esmf\\_core & test but not by greg, sent an word document. \r\n\r\n\r\n9 Oct\r\nfrom Cecelia\r\nhttp://mailman.ucar.edu/pipermail/test/2006-October/000040.html\r\nsystem: PC using mozilla mail\r\nfile: .xls\r\nstatus: passed\r\n\r\n9 Oct\r\nfrom Cecelia\r\nhttp://mailman.ucar.edu/pipermail/test/2006-October/000041.html\r\nsystem: linux\r\nfile: .xls\r\nstatus: passed\r\n\r\n9 Oct\r\nfrom Silverio\r\nhttp://mailman.ucar.edu/pipermail/test/2006-October/000041.html\r\nsystem: mac using mac mail\r\nfile: .xls\r\nstatus: partial failure, extension changed to .obj\r\n\r\n\r\n9 Oct\r\nfrom Silverio\r\nhttp://mailman.ucar.edu/pipermail/test/2006-October/000042.html\r\nsystem: mac using mac mail\r\nfile: .pdf & .doc\r\nstatus: partial failure, .doc extension changed to .obj, pdf passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nPre changes to mailman version.

All lists had content filtering turned \r\noff, so I sent a test .rtf file to esmf\\_support.  The archival should have passed since the setting for both lists were the same.  It did not pass. why?\r\n\r\n23 Oct\r\nfrom Sylvia\r\nhttp://mailman.ucar.edu/pipermail/esmf\\_support/2006-October/004585.html\r\nsystem: Mac powerbook G4 using thunderbird\r\nfile: .rtf\r\nstatus :  failed \"Skipped content of type multipart/mixed\"\r\n\r\ngreg could not fathom why the test to this mailing list would fail when tests to esmf\\_core passed.

He did not know if that would effect what  we have seen. The group initiated a series of tests to see what might have changed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27 Dec\r\nfrom Sylvia\r\nhttp://mailman.ucar.edu/mailman/private/esmf\\_core/2006-December/002295.html\r\nsystem: mac with macmail\r\nfile: unknown \\(2 files probably pdf and xls\\)\r\ntype: content filtering set to off\r\nstatus: failed \"Skipped content of type multipart/mixed\"\r\n\r\n\r\n27 Dec\r\nfrom Sylvia\r\nhttp://mailman.ucar.edu/mailman/private/esmf\\_core/2006-December/002296.html\r\nsystem: mac with macmail\r\nfile: unknown \\(2 files probably pdf and xls\\)\r\ntype: content filtering turned on but only default mime types listed\r\nstatus: failed \"Skipped content of type multipart/mixed\"\r\n\r\n\r\n27 Dec\r\nfrom Sylvia\r\nhttp://mailman.ucar.edu/mailman/private/esmf\\_core/2006-December/002297.html\r\nsystem: mac with macmail\r\nfile: unknown \\(2 files probably pdf and xls\\)\r\ntype: content filtering turned and many \"pass\" mime types listed\r\nstatus: failed \"Skipped content of type multipart/mixed\"\r\n\r\n\r\n27 Dec\r\nfrom Sylvia\r\nhttp://mailman.ucar.edu/mailman/private/esmf\\_core/2006-December/002298.html\r\nsystem: mac with macmail\r\nfile: unknown \\(just one, probably pdf\\)\r\ntype: content filtering turned and many \"pass\" mime types listed\r\nstatus: failed , no indication file existed at all. \r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nbefore the upgrade these files would have been archived.

All\r\nthe NASA\r\npeople would need to do is self register using the New User\r\nRegistration\r\nlink on the login page.\r\nhttps://schcustomersupport.ucar.edu\r\nThere are five required fields \\(red\\) the new user would need\r\nto fill in\r\nto gain limited access to ExtraView \\(add and view an issue,\r\nbut not edit\r\nor update an issue\\).  Their issue would then route to SCD\r\nCustomer\r\nSupport \\(CPG\\), who would then transfer the issue to ESMF. \r\nThe ESMF\r\nmembers would have to be setup as Resolvers in the system,\r\nso they can\r\nupdate the issue and the customer via email and eventually\r\nclose it\r\nout.  If you decided to use ExtraView for ESMF issues, then\r\nyou would\r\nneed to educate CPG as to the type of issues you deal with\r\nfor your\r\nCustomer community, and we would need to probably setup internal\r\ncategories which would fit the type of issues you resolve.  The\r\ninformation you provide would need to be added to CPG's\r\nknowledge and\r\nrouting document.  In the application CPG is the first point\r\nof contact\r\nfor the Customer.  Also you would want to see if the current\r\napplication\r\nwould allow you to resolve your issues correctly.  If SCD\r\nHelp Desk were\r\nto be used by ESMF, this would need to by approved by our\r\nChange Control\r\ngroup.  This is made up of Linda La Brie, Dick Valent,\r\nMarkus Stobbs and\r\nmyself.\r\nThanks,\r\nIngmar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI told markus we were not interested at this time b/c\r\nextraview as too much of a NCAR brand and it also involved\r\nyet another login for folks. \r\n",

This is a problem because\r\n\\- we are not taking advantage of outreach opportunities\r\n\\- we don't follow up with people who download, or track\r\nthe progress of small ESMF-based projects\r\n\\- we aren't making sure that we are resolving all the\r\nissues that a particular customer or code has that\r\nstand in the way of ESMF adoption.  This is important\r\nbecause we usually need to take care of a suite of\r\nthings in order for a particular customer to move their\r\nESMF code into production\r\n\\- we don't manage the interfaces to customers all that\r\nwell - the same customer may end up dealing with a\r\nbunch of different people, without any coordinated\r\noversight\r\n\\- we aren't collecting good metrics about how many\r\ncodes are ESMF compatible, what the adoption status of\r\ncodes is, how satisfied \\(or unsatisfied\\) customers are,\r\nand what obstacles stand in the way of user adoption.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS/DESIRES\r\n\\- For each ESMF code or wanna-be code, record contact\r\npeople, agency, institution, adoption status, ideally\r\nassociated support requests, type of component, and\r\nnotes from any direct contacts.\r\n\\- View by customer or code.\r\n\\- Interface should be browser based, with some fields\r\nsuch as customer number with limited access.  ~All\r\nbrowsers have to be supported\\!\r\n\r\nOPTIONS:\r\ni\\) SF code tracker\r\nStatus:  This is easy to set up and I went ahead and\r\ndid a prototype.

In addition to technical details, I am going to put\r\nthis in perspective a little:\r\n\r\nhistory lesson:\r\n\r\nWe are seeing a huge growth in distributed projects like\r\nours because of the technological revolution that began with\r\nthe creation of the \r\na\\) internet \\(just the hardware side here\\)\r\nb\\) the PC which allowed for individuals to create documents\r\nc\\) Windows which made doing more on pc's easier\r\nd\\) WWW which created that world wide interface that we\r\nknow and love\r\ne\\) the dot.com boom which laid down fiber optic cables\r\naround the world\r\nf\\) AND FINALLY work flow software\r\n\r\nwhat is facinating here is that work flow is becoming the\r\nnext great leap forward. This ties into the potential NCAR\r\nwork flow project for modeling but also how projects and\r\ncompanies do business. \r\n\r\nTo a great extent, the work flow revolution is corresponding\r\nwith another revolution which is hosted software. Instead of\r\npurchasing a software lisence, there is a trended to hosted\r\nsoftware where the IT is handled remotely and customers pay\r\na per month fee to access a solution that includes data\r\nstorage. This is what is empowering the outsourcing of\r\ntechnical call centers, tax preparation, and distributed\r\nsoftware development. Google's experimentation with\r\nspreadsheets is an example of this trend. I wonder if they\r\nplan to charge for this at some point in the future?\r\n\r\nESMF is a distributed project and we need host software\r\ntools for client relations, bug tracking and support request\r\ntracking. As an open source project though we need to\r\nminimize our expenses. Many of the main vendors out there\r\nare expensive. \r\n\r\n\\* Seibel has teamed up with IBM for a hosted\r\nCRM solution which is far more sophisticated than we need.\r\nThey charge $70/user/month.  \r\n\r\n\\* Quicken has a whole suite of \r\nsoftware including a customizable data base. I was very\r\nquickly able to generate two relational tables, one for\r\ncodes and the other for programs and customize them in\r\nseveral ways. They charge $249/month for 10 users +\r\n$15/month for each additional user. What is our budget?\r\n\r\nWhile the opensource and freeware industry has been able to\r\nprovide lots of software that ngo's, labs, and educational\r\ninstitutions have used to keep their costs down, this trend\r\ntoward hosted software will require increased expense. It is\r\nthe best means to collaborate distributedly, however.\r\n\r\n",

This interface was acceptable to us.  We QC'ed their format and made some suggestions and requests.  This is a summary from Luca on where we stand:\r\n\r\nHi Cecelia, Sylvia,\r\nas per our meeting yesterday the following items have been already changed onto the CDP development site:\r\n\r\n\"DONE\r\no \"Nested Datasets\" is now \"Nested Collections\"\r\no \"Click here for ESMF data access\" is now \"Click here for ESMF downloads\"\r\no More space between registration table cells\r\no bigger text space for Statement of Work field\r\no insert instructions on mailing lists at the top of ESMF registration page\r\n\r\nThe following items can be changed easily, but we need input from you guys:\r\n\r\nTO DO\r\no have registration field for \"Type of Model\"\r\no change description of optional mailing list\r\no insert ESMF logo\r\no need exact text for ESMF registration instructions\r\n\r\n\r\nIncidentally, in answer to your question yesterday, I think the best way to link the ESMF site to the CDP would simply be to link to the CDP home page, and ask people to click on the ESMF collection. But if you want to give a more direct URL, the following link will behave as follows:\r\n\r\nlink to ESMF downloads: http://cdp.ucar.edu/browse/browse.htm?uri=http://dataportal.ucar.edu/metadata/esmf/esmf.thredds.xml\r\n\\- if user is already registered and affiliated with ESMF, he/she will be asked to login, then dropped in the top-level ESMF catalog\r\n\\- if user is registered with CDP but NOT already affiliated with ESMF, he/she will be directed to the ESMF registration page, and upon completion to the above URL\r\n\\- if user is not registered with CDP yet, they will have to click on the \"create new account\" link and go through the registration process\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLuca\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt some point we expect them to complete all requests and we will do another demo.",

We need to test the downloads they may be broken. \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\r\nSylvia Murphy\r\n\r\n\r\n:\\(\r\n\r\nWhat would be required to make this work without CDP?\r\n\r\n\r\nthe only option is a temp fix. In other words, doing this opens up a security issue that the WEG is not happy about. They would let us do it\r\ntemporarily knowing it would only be for a few months. e.g. if the cdp did not exist, we would not have much of a recourse. now, realistically, I suspect we could do something if that were the case, but it would have a long security vetting period and a lot of whining on our part. M did indicate that  could take their current feedback.cgi script and try to modify it, again only temporarily, but that it would be non-trivial to do. so the question comes down to time. If it takes a month to do and we are up on the cdp in two months, they we have spent a month\r\nto gain a month etc.  This script is not designed to execute anything and what we want to do is an execution. If you want I will get the code from them and at least look at it\r\n\r\n\r\nC and I decided to get the code from both Markus and Luca in order to better jugde what it will take to acheive this. C revealed that it may be longer than 2 months to get the CDP downloads on line and therefore an interm solution is desired.\r\n\r\n",

I will get a better idea of what the current script does when they send me a copy. I put in a request last week.  The security issues are not related to the style of solution we choose, but to the extra security protocols that would have to be in place regardless of style. For instance you have to check for, and exclude certain characters that would allow a hacker access to the system. Once the script was up and working, I would have them do a code review on it.  I am leaning away from JSP not b/c of tomcat which I am assuming is already installed and running on the web server but b/c luca's solution is a very tiny chunk of a much larger system and puting those pieces together will be much more complicated than we need or have time for.

These people will\r\n&gt;&gt; need continuous access to the CVS repository.\r\n&gt;&gt;\r\n&gt;&gt; Thanks,\r\n&gt;&gt; Cecelia\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Initially the items may go into a separate\r\nrequirements tracker so we can get a sense of the\r\nnature of the items and how they might integrate with\r\nexisting trackers.\r\n\r\nThe Requirements doc can then be made obsolete and\r\nremoved from both the project website and the source code.\r\n\r\nThis will solve a long-standing project issue of what\r\nto do about the Requirements doc.  \\(We tried to solve\r\nit with the Doors package but ran into trouble with too\r\nmany unsupported platforms/browsers, and abandoned that\r\neffort.\\)\r\n\r\n\\-- Cecelia",

Not perfect or ideal but does work.\r\n\r\nWe can create tasks in freeCRM that a user will see when they log in. They won't get email reminders. You can't create reaccuring tasks but would have to input them individually.\r\n\r\nFor myself, they way I have gotten around this to to open one task and when complete, change the date to the following week.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrankly, meeting maker would work just as well if not better for this so the question I have is:\r\n\r\nDo you anticipate non-core folks needing a tracker?  If not we can use meeting maker.  If so, does it matter if a person uses\r\nfreeCRM or meeting maker? Do you have a need for seeing the tasks and their completion?\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I was putting together a few slides on Curator and METAFOR for an ESG presentation, and went hunting on web pages for information. While the Curator page does list NSF and NASA as partners down at the bottom, NSF is missing on the \"Partners\" page. I believe our current guidance is that NSF is always listed first and foremost.\r\n\r\ndon\r\n",

  "description": "The following was submitted as Issue \\#51544 with CISL Customer Support on 3/9/10:\r\n\r\nIssue Summary:\r\n\\-------------------------\r\nPlease install Xerces C++ XML Parser in central location on Bluefire\r\n\r\nIssue Description:\r\n\\---------------------------\r\nIn order to inter-operate with emerging systems such as Curator and ESG, ESMF is developing XML-based I/O \r\ncapabilities, which require the use of the 3rd party Xerces C++XML Parser software.  As our user base grows and \r\ncomes to depend on our XML I/O features, we need Xerces to be installed on supercomputer hosts in centrally \r\navailable locations, much like netCDF is today.  So we would like to request that it be installed as such on \r\nBluefire.\r\n\r\nAs a guide, you can use the installation of Xerces we currently use on Bluefire, which I installed under my home \r\ndirectory:\r\n\r\n/blhome/eschwab/xerces/3.1.0/xlC/10.1.0.5\r\n\r\nThe path is specific for the version of Xerces, currently 3.1.0, and the version of the C++ compiler on Bluefire, \r\ncurrently 10.1.0.5.  Under this directory is the \"build\" directory, where I downloaded and built the Xerces source \r\ntarball.  There you will find my \"notes\" file showing the commands I used to build the library.  The commands came \r\nfrom the instructions on the Xerces website for building on AIX platforms.  Here is the website:\r\n\r\nhttp://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c\r\n\r\nOn the left panel, there are links for downloading and documentation for building & installing.  Please start with \r\nthe source tarball, currently xerces-c-3.1.0.tar.gz, and build with the current C++ compiler on Bluefire to ensure \r\nconsistency with ESMF and other codes built on Bluefire.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance\\!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\\-- Earl Schwab\r\nESMF Core Team\r\nNOAA/ESRL\r\nBoulder, CO",

Further more we may want to put stronger emphasis on warnings that come out of external demos, examples, unit test, or system test codes, than those coming out of the ESMF library.
