multi-PET is hanging.', 'ticket_form.custom_fields._category': 'Bug', 'ticket_form.labels': '', 'ticket_form.description': 'WHO: Gerhard, ESMF Core\n\nWorking on the ESMF CoupledFlow demo I noticed that the FieldWrite() method started hanging in the second call in multi-PET execution when the "timeslice" option was being used. The first call correctly produced the NetCDF file, but the second call just hung on all PETs. The timeslice option seems to work fine for single-PET execution. Looking through the I/O UTests in ESMF I don\'t see where the timeslice option is tested anywhere! This needs testing and probably fixing.\n*gjt*\n---\nsamsoncheung\nSat, 27 Nov 2010 17:01:35\nGerhard found that the reason this is hanging for him (in both the demo and the IOUTests) is that he is using MPICH on my system. We don\'t use MPICH on any of our official test platforms anymore, and so we don\'t see this anywhere else.\n\nFinally he switched the demo on the HEAD back to using timeslicing, and tested with 4P on pluto/gfortran/mpich2. The result is that timeslicing seems to work just fine for that configuration.\n\n---\n\n---\nsamsoncheung\nThu, 20 Jan 2011 09:57:24\nThis is the email traffic Gerhard and I had.  I installed MPICH1 and it works for me.  So there are some environments different between us.  It is documented in the email below.\n\n--------------------------------- Original Message ---------------------------------\nSubject: Re: [Esmf_core] FieldIOUTest fails FieldWrite\nFrom:    "Gerhard Theurich" <theurich@sourcespring.net>\nDate:    Tue, December 14, 2010 8:43 am\nTo:      "Samson Cheung" <cheung@math.ucdavis.edu>\nCc:      "Fei Liu" <fei.liu@gmail.com>\n         "esmf_core core" <esmf_core@list.woc.noaa.gov>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSamson,\n\nThat is very interesting! So now it could be a number of things:\n\n1) MPICH version (I use 1.2.7.1, you seem to use 1.2.6 (you said in your email \nyesterday you downloaded 1.2.5, but in the "gmake info" you sent the mpich \nwrappers report 1.2.6).\n\n2) MPICH config options (need to look at them in more detail, also taking into \naccount what defaults are).\n\n3) Intel compiler version (I use 9.0(20050912Z), while you use 11.1(20100203).\n\n4) I suspect you have a later glibc on you box than I do. My glibc is 2.3.3.\n\n5) ABI (I am on ia32, while you are on x86_64).\n\n\nObviously the further down in the list the harder it will be to do anything \nabout the difference. The higher up items are easier. I\'ll start messing with it \nas I get to it. Thanks for setting this up on your box and running the tests, it \nis helpful to know that MPICH1 in principle should work!\n\n-Gerhard\n\nIntel/9.0/20050912Z/mpich/1.2.7.1\n\nSamson Cheung wrote:\n> Gerhard,\n> \n> I see.
