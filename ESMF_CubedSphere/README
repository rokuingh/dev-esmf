ESMF_HelloWorld                     README
---------------                     ------

This directory contains code that is based on the ESMF Fortran API.

The application prints "Hello ESMF World" to stdout. The code is accompanied
by a generic Makefile that builds the executable. This Makefile should work 
unmodified on any system where ESMF is installed and environment variable
ESMFMKFILE is set according to the instructions given in the ESMF User's Guide.

NOTE:
The executable should be run according to the system-specific procedures that
apply to the execution of binaries. The correct procedure may depend on whether
the executable was built against an mpiuni- or mpi-based ESMF library
installation.
