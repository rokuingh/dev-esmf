ESMF_HelloWorld                     README
---------------                     ------

This directory contains code that is based on the ESMF Fortran API.

The application prints "Hello ESMF World" to stdout. The code is accompanied
by CMakeLists.txt and cmake/FindESMF.cmake files. It builds using the typical
CMake procedure:

mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make

The FindESMF.cmake file depends on environment variable ESMFMKFILE being set
according to the instructions given in the ESMF User's Guide.

NOTE:
The executable should be run according to the system-specific procedures that
apply to the execution of binaries. The correct procedure may depend on whether
the executable was built against an mpiuni- or mpi-based ESMF library
installation.
