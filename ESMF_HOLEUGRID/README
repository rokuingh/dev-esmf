Hello, this is the README file.

ESMF must be built and installed for this testing application to run properly.

The ESMF library must be built with NetCDF support.

If the ESMF library has already been built on the system you are using, you 
should only have to set the ESMFMKFILE environment variable.
This environment variable should point to the esmf.mk file in the INSTALLED 
version of the ESMF library.

Some useful commands you can issue in this directory:

gmake       - build the application
gmake dust  - clean out .o and .mod files
gmake clean - clean the directory and start over

===============================================================================

Please contact esmf_support@list.woc.noaa.gov with any questions or problems.
