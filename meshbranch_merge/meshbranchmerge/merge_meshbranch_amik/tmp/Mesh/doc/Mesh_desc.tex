Unstructured grids are commonly used in the computational solution of Partial Differential equations.  These are especially useful for problems that involve complex geometry, where using the less flexible structured grids can
result in grid representation of regions where no computation is needed.  Finite
element and finite volume methods map naturally to unstructured grids and are used commonly
in hydrology, ocean modeling, and many other applications.

In order to provide support for application codes using unstructured grids, the ESMF library provides a class for representing 
unstructured grids called the {\bf Mesh}. Fields can be created on a Mesh to hold data. Fields created on a Mesh can also be used 
as either the source or destination or both of an interpolaton (i.e. an {\tt ESMF\_FieldRegridStore()} call) in ESMF allowing data to be 
moved to or from or between unstructured grids. This section describes the Mesh and how to create and use them in ESMF. 

\subsubsection{Mesh Representation in ESMF}

A Mesh in ESMF is described in terms of {\bf nodes} and {\bf elements}. A node is a point in space which represents where the coordinate 
information in a Mesh is located. This is also where Field data may be located in a Mesh (i.e. Fields may be created on a Mesh's nodes). An 
element is a higher dimensional shape constructed of nodes. Elements give a Mesh its shape and define the relationship of the nodes to one 
another. 

\subsubsection{Supported Meshes}

The range of Meshes supported by ESMF are defined by several factors: dimension, element types, and distribution.

ESMF currently only supports Meshes whose number of coordinate dimensions (spatial dimension) is 2 or 3. The dimension of the elements in a Mesh
(parametric dimension) must be less than or equal to the spatial dimension, but also must be either 2 or 3. This means that an ESMF mesh may be
either 2D elements in 2D space, 3D elements in 3D space, or a manifold constructed of 2D elements embedded in 3D space. 

ESMF currently supports two types of elements for each Mesh parametric dimension. For a parametric dimension of 2 the 
supported element types are triangles or quadralaterals. For a parametric dimension of 3 the supported element types are tetrahedrons
and hexahedrons. See Section~\ref{sec:mesh:opt:elemtype} for diagrams of these. The Mesh supports any combination of element types within a particular
dimension, but types from different dimensions may not be mixed, for example, a Mesh cannot be constructed of both quadralaterals and tetrahedra.

ESMF currently only supports distributions where every node on a PET must be a part of an element on that PET. In other words, there 
must not be nodes without an element on a PET.
