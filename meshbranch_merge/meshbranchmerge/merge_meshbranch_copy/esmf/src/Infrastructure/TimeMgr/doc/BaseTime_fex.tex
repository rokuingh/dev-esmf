The BaseTime class is not intended for users; it is only used internally as a
base class for TimeInterval and Time.  The F90 definition for
Time is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
      use ESMF_BaseTimeMod

     type ESMF_Time
     sequence                           ! match C++ storage order
     private                            !   (members opaque on F90 side)
       type(ESMF_BaseTime) :: baseTime           ! inherit base class
       type(ESMF_Calendar), pointer :: calendar  ! associated calendar
       integer :: timeZone                       ! local timezone
     end type
\end{verbatim}
