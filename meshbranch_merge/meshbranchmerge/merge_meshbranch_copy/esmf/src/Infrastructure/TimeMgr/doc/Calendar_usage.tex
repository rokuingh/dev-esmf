In most multi-component Earth system applications, the timekeeping in 
each component 
must refer to the same standard calendar in order for the components 
to properly synchronize.  It therefore makes sense to create as few 
ESMF Calendars as possible, preferably one per application.
A typical strategy would be to create a single Calendar at the start
of an application, and use that Calendar in all subsequent calls that
accept a Calendar, such as {\tt ESMF\_TimeSet}.

The following example shows how to set up an ESMF Calendar.
