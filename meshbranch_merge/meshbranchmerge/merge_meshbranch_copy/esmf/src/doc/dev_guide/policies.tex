\section{Policies}

\subsection{External Software Libraries}
\label{sec:lib}

ESMF developers are encouraged to use as few external
software libraries as possible, to minimize the effort
needed to build and run the ESMF software.  The external
utilities and libraries that the ESMF distribution relies
on are listed on the {\bf Download} tab of the ESMF website.  

\subsection{Graphics Packages}

ESMF uses the MS Visio package to produce its graphics.
Both Visio files and *.eps files are checked into the 
main repository.
