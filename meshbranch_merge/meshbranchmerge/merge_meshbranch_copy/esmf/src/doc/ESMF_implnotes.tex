\section{Overall Design and Implementation Notes}
\label{sec:overallimpl}

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Deep and shallow classes.}  The deep and shallow classes 
described in Section \ref{sec:deepshallow} differ in how and where they
are allocated within a multi-language implementation environment.  We
distinguish between the implementation language, which is the language
a method is written in, and the calling language, which is the language
that the user application is written in.  Deep classes are allocated 
off the process heap by the implementation language.  Shallow classes
are allocated off the stack by the calling language.  

\item {\bf Base class.} All ESMF classes are built upon a Base class,
which holds a small set of system-wide capabilities.  

\end{enumerate}
