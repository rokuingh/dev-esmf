! !IROUTINE: ESMF_CplCompGetInternalState - Get private data block pointer
!
! !INTERFACE:
!      subroutine ESMF_CplCompGetInternalState(cplcomp, dataPointer, rc)
!
! !ARGUMENTS:
!      type(ESMF_CplComp), intent(inout) :: cplcomp
!      type(any), pointer, intent(in) :: dataPointer
!      integer, intent(out) :: rc
!
! !DESCRIPTION:
!  Available to be called by an {\tt ESMF\_CplComp} at any time after 
!  {\tt ESMF\_CplCompSetInternalState} has been called.
!  Since init, run, and finalize must be separate subroutines data that
!  they need to share in common can either be module global data, or can
!  be allocated in a private data block and the address of that block
!  can be registered with the framework and retrieved by this call.
!  When running multiple instantiations of an {\tt ESMF\_CplComp}, 
!  for example during ensemble runs, 
!  it may be simpler to maintain private data specific to 
!  each run with private data blocks.  A corresponding 
!  {\tt ESMF\_CplCompSetInternalState} call sets the data pointer to 
!  this block, and this call retrieves the data pointer.   
!  Note that the {\tt dataPointer} argument needs to be a derived type
!  which contains only a pointer of the type of the data block defined
!  by the user.  When making this call the pointer needs to be unassociated.
!  When the call returns the pointer will now reference the original
!  data block which was set during the previous call to
!  {\tt ESMF\_CplCompSetInternalState}.
!    
!  The arguments are:
!  \begin{description}
!   \item[cplcomp]
!    An {\tt ESMF\_CplComp} object.
!   \item[dataPointer]
!    A derived type, containing only an unassociated pointer 
!    to the private data block.
!    The framework will fill in the pointer. When this call returns the
!    pointer is set to the same address set during 
!    {\tt ESMF\_CplCompSetInternalState}.
!    This level of indirection is needed to reliably set and retrieve 
!    the data block no matter which architecture or compiler is used.  
!   \item[rc] 
!    Return code; equals {\tt ESMF\_SUCCESS} if there are no errors.
!    Note: unlike most other ESMF routines, this argument is not optional
!    because of implementation considerations.

! !IROUTINE: ESMF_CplCompSetEntryPoint - Set name of CplComp subroutines
!
! !INTERFACE:
!      subroutine ESMF_CplCompSetEntryPoint(comp, subroutineType, &
!                                            subroutineName, phase, rc)
!
! !ARGUMENTS:
!      type(ESMF_CplComp), intent(inout) :: comp
!      character(len=*), intent(in) :: subroutineType
!      subroutine, intent(in) :: subroutineName
!      integer, intent(in) :: phase
!      integer, intent(out) :: rc
!
! !DESCRIPTION:
!  Intended to be called by an {\tt ESMF\_CplComp} during its SetServices
!  routine. An {\tt ESMF\_CplComp} calls {\tt ESMF\_CplCompSetEntryPoint}
!  for each of the predefined initialize, run, and finalize routines, 
!  to assocate the internal subroutine to be called for each function. 
!  If multiple phases for init, run, or finalize are needed, this can be 
!  called with phase numbers.
!
!  After this subroutine returns, the framework knows how to call the
!  initialize, run, and finalize routines for this component.
!    
!  The arguments are:
!  \begin{description}
!   \item[comp]
!    An {\tt ESMF\_CplComp} object.
!   \item[subroutineType]
!    One of a set of predefined subroutine types - e.g. {\tt ESMF\_SETINIT}, 
!    {\tt ESMF\_SETRUN}, {\tt ESMF\_SETFINAL}.
!   \item[subroutineName]
!    The name of the user-supplied {\tt cplcomp} subroutine to be associated with the
!    {\tt subroutineType}.  This subroutine does not have to be
!    public to the module.
!   \item[{[phase]}] 
!    For {\tt ESMF\_CplComp}s which need to initialize, run, or finalize 
!    with mutiple phases, the phase number which 
!    corresponds to this subroutine name.
!    For single phase subroutines, either omit this argument, or use the
!    parameter {\tt ESMF\_SINGLEPHASE}.   The {\tt ESMF\_CplComp} writer 
!    must document
!    the requirements of the {\tt ESMF\_CplComp} for how and when 
!    the multiple phases are expected to be called.
!   \item[rc] 
!    Return code; equals {\tt ESMF\_SUCCESS} if there are no errors.
!    Note: unlike most other ESMF routines, this argument is not optional
!    because of implementation considerations.
!   \end{description}
!
! The component writer must supply a subroutine with the exact interface 
! shown below. Arguments must not be declared as optional, and the types and
! order must match.
!
! !INTERFACE:
!      interface
!        subroutine subroutineName (comp, importState, exportState, clock, rc)
!          type(ESMF\_CplComp)  :: comp                     ! must not be optional
!          type(ESMF\_State)    :: importState, exportState ! must not be optional
!          type(ESMF\_Clock)    :: clock                    ! must not be optional

!
! !DESCRIPTION:
!  Available to be called by an {\tt ESMF\_CplComp} at any time, but 
!  expected to be
!  most useful when called during the registration process, or initialization.
!  Since init, run, and finalize must be separate subroutines data that
!  they need to share in common can either be module global data, or can
!  be allocated in a private data block and the address of that block
!  can be registered with the framework and retrieved by subsequent calls.
!  When running multiple instantiations of an {\tt ESMF\_CplComp}, 
!  for example during
!  ensemble runs, it may be simpler to maintain private data specific to 
!  each run with private data blocks.  A corresponding 
!  {\tt ESMF\_CplCompGetInternalState} call retrieves the data pointer.
!    
!  The arguments are:
!  \begin{description}
!   \item[cplcomp] 
!    An {\tt ESMF\_CplComp} object.
!   \item[dataPointer]
!    A pointer to the private data block, wrapped in a derived type which
!    contains only a pointer to the block.  This level of indirection is
!    needed to reliably set and retrieve the data block no matter which
!    architecture or compiler is used.  
!   \item[rc] 
!    Return code; equals {\tt ESMF\_SUCCESS} if there are no errors.
!    Note: unlike most other ESMF routines, this argument is not optional
