Settings for Darwin (Mac OS X), using the GNU g95 compiler and the GNU C++
compiler (g++).

Requires the following environment settings:

ESMF_COMPILER g95


Notes:

The internal sizes of F90 pointers changed in some g95 compiler
versions built after may 4th, 2008.  To find out which compiler
version you are using, type:

  g95 --version

ESMC_Conf.h is currently using values for ESMF_F90_PTR_BASE_SIZE
and ESMF_F90_PTR_PLUS_RANK appropriate for compilers prior to this
change.

If you are using a newer version of g95, and are getting unit
test errors from ESMF_F90ArrayPtrUTest in particular, you need to
override the settings in ESMC_Conf.h (either by editing ESMC_Conf.h
or by setting environment variables as described below).  The stdout
file from ESMF_F90ArrayPtrUTest provides guidance for the correct values
for your system. Set environment variables ESMF_F90_PTR_BASE_SIZE and/or
ESMF_F90_PTR_PLUS_RANK accordingly and rebuild the ESMF library.
