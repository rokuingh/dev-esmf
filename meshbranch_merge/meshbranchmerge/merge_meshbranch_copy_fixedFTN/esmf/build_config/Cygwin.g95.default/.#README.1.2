Settings for Cygwin, using the g95 fortran compiler and the GCC C++ compiler.
 
Requires the following environment settings:

ESMF_COMPILER g95

Notes:

The internal sizes of F90 pointers changed in some g95 compiler
versions built after may 4th, 2008.  To find out which compiler
version you are using, type:

  g95 --version

ESMC_Conf.h is currently using values for ESMF_F90_PTR_BASE_SIZE
and ESMF_F90_PTR_PLUS_RANK appropriate for compilers prior to this
change.

If you are using a newer version of g95, and are getting unit
test errors from ESMF_F95PtrUTest in particular, the settings
in ESMC_Conf.h need to be modified accordingly.  The stdout file
from ESMF_F95PtrUTest can provide guidance for the correct values
for your system.
