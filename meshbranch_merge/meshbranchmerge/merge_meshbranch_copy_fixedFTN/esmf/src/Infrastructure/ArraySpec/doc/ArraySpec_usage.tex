%\subsection{Use and Examples}

The ArraySpec is passed in as an argument at Field and 
FieldBundle creation in order to describe an Array that will 
be allocated or attached at a later time.  There are any
number of situations in which this approach is useful.  
One common example is a case in which the user wants to create
a very flexible export State with many diagnostic variables 
predefined, but only a subset desired and consequently 
allocated for a particular run.
