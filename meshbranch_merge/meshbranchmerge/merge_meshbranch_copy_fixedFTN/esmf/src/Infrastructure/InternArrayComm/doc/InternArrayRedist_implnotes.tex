Like Regrid, Redist has been designed to be as efficient as possible during its
Run routine.  The calculation of redistribution mostly involves determining
intersections in index space between DEs from the source and destination data
structures.  Although this initial calculation during the Store routines
can be computationally intensive, the {\tt ESMF\_RouteHandle} object
it creates is designed to be reused by similar Fields on the same IGrids.
And, as long as the IGrids are static, RegridStore can be called once
and reused throughout a simulation.  It leverages internal structures
and methods used throughout ESMF to precompute communication patterns and
store them for application.

\subsubsection{Redist Objects}

There is no {\tt ESMF\_Redist} object per se.  Users are returned an
{\tt ESMF\_RouteHandle} object, which contains one or more {\tt ESMF\_Routes}
used to gather source data, and an identifier for the type of RouteHandle.  These
objects are private and users are not expected to access or modify them.
