An ESMF Field represents a physical field, such as temperature.
The motivation for including Fields in ESMF is that bundles of 
Fields are the entities that are normally exchanged when coupling
Components.  

The ESMF Field class contains distributed, discretized field data, a reference 
to its associated grid, and metadata.  The Field class maintains the
relationship of how a data array maps onto a grid (e.g. one item per
cell located at the cell center, one item per cell located at the NW
corner,  one item per cell vertex, ...).  This means that different Fields
which are on the same underlying ESMF Grid but have different
staggerings can share the same Grid object without needing to replicate
it multiple times. 

Fields can be added to States for use in inter-Component
data communications.  Fields can also be added to FieldBundles,
which are currently defined as groups of Fields on the same underlying
grid.  One motivation for FieldBundles is convenience; another is the
ability to perform optimized collective data transfers.  

Field communications, including data redistribution, regriding, scatter,
gather, sparse-matrix matmul, and halo update, are enabled in this release.

ESMF does not currently support vector fields, so the components of 
a vector field must be stored as separate Field objects.
