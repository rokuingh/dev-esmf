# note: this test is set up to run with a variety of different processor 
#  counts (1, 2, and any even number up to 32).  we used to run it with 
#  -np 12, but on some of the smaller machines that used to hang in the
#  mpi code (running out of resources).  so we dropped it down to 6, but
#  on the larger machines we could run this with larger processor counts.
