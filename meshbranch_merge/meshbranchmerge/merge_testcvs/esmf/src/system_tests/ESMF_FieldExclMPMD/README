This is the MPMD version of the ESMF_FieldExcl system test. This MPMD application consists of two executables. The difference between these executables is which if the two models it uses and is linked against:

ESMF_FieldExclMPMDSTestA  -> use user_model1
ESMF_FieldExclMPMDSTestB  -> use user_model2

Both executables use the coupler component: user_coupler.

On a source code level the difference between ESMF_FieldExclMPMDSTestA.F90 and 
ESMF_FieldExclMPMDSTestB.F90 is achieved by using preprocessor #ifdefs around those sections of code that differ between executable A and B. There is only one line of code different between the two application drivers and that is the line that #defines which model is to be used.

Note:
Startup of MPMD applications is problematic on some systems. There is a chance that executing "gmake run" in this directory will not be successful on some platforms.
