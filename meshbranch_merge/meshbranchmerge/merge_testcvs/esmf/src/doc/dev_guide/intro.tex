\subsection{About this Document}
The Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) {\it Software Developer's Guide},
or simply the {\it Guide}, is the reference handbook that describes
the practices, standards, and conventions recommended for ESMF core software
development.  It is updated as needed.

Suggestions on how to improve the {\it Guide} should be sent to 
\htmladdnormallink{esmf\_support@list.woc.noaa.gov}{mailto:esmf\_support@list.woc.noaa.gov}.

This website is referred to throughout the {\it Guide}.  
It includes a link to the ESMF CVS repository, the current release
schedule, task lists, and many other types of project information.

The {\it Guide} doesn't contain instructions on how to build
ESMF, adapt user codes for ESMF, or use the ESMF interfaces.
