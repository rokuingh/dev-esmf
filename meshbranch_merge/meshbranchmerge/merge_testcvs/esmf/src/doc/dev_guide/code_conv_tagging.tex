\subsection{Repo: Source Code Naming and Tagging Conventions}
\label{sec:tagging}

We provide two types of releases, public and internal, with similar tagging conventions.

\subsubsection{Public Releases}
Public releases are each given a branch created from the main CVS repository ESMF trunk. The tagging convention
for public releases is
{\tt ESMF\_*\_*\_*r[p\#]}, e.g., {\tt ESMF\_0\_2\_1r}, where the first digit represents a major release, the
second digit an incremental release, the third digit a routine update, and an official release {\tt r}.
Subsequent patches to the release are identified with the letter {\tt p} followed by the patch number,
e.g., {\tt ESMF\_1\_0\_0rp2}. Patches are tagged on the release branch.

\subsubsection{Internal Releases}
ESMF software internal releases are identified as tags on the CVS main trunk.
The tagging convention for internal releases is
{\tt ESMF\_*\_*\_*}, e.g., {\tt ESMF\_1\_0\_1}, where the first digit represents a
major release, the second digit an incremental release, and the third digit a routine update.
