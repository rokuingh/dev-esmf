System Test FieldHalo requires 12 DE's to run.  The mpirun script will not work
for this many processes on all platforms, so the following notes are hints at
running this test on some of the platforms.

On RS6000_SP's with less than 12 processors per node:
     setenv MP_RMPOOL 1
     setenv MP_NODES 3
     setenv MP_TASKS_PER_NODE 4
     setenv MP_PROCS 12

     and then run.
