\section{The ESMF User's Guide}

This {\it ESMF User's Guide} is mainly an installation and build guide for
the new ESMF user and a build reference for the experienced user.  
New users are strongly encouraged to download the ESMF software and try
running a quick start program, {\tt quick\_start}, that illustrates
both ESMF utilities and coupling services.  

The {\it User's Guide} is organized as follows.  The next two sections, 
\ref{sec:Support} and \ref{sec:Submission}, 
concern user support and how to submit comments on the ESMF system 
to our development team.  
Sections \ref{sec:QuickStart} through \ref{sec:TechOver2} contain a 
{\it Quick Start} guide that explains how to install the ESMF software 
and run the self-tests, 
followed by more detail on ESMF structure and operation, 
such as a description of the directory structure and how to build and
run the ESMF examples and quick start programs.
Section \ref{sec:ArchOver} is an architectural overview that describes the
framework's basic goals and features.  
%The next few Sections, beginning
%with \ref{sec:demo}, describe in detail the {\tt ESMF\_COUPLED\_FLOW} demo
%application.
Section \ref{sec:Adoption} details the steps required to adapt a component
for use with ESMF.  Finally, to help you become familiar with ESMF
terminology, the last section in the {\it User's Guide} is a glossary.

design the framework consists of two parts, an upper level
{\bf superstructure} layer and a lower-level {\bf infrastructure} layer. 
User code is sandwiched between these two layers.}
