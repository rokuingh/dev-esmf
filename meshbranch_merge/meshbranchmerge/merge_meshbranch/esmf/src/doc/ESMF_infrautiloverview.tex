\section{Overview of Infrastructure Utility Classes}

The ESMF utilities are
a set of tools for quickly assembling modeling applications.
The Time Management Library
provides utilities for time and date representation and calculation,
and higher-level utilities that control model time stepping and alarming.

The Array class offers an efficient, language-neutral way 
of storing and manipulating data arrays.

The Communications/Memory/Kernel library provides utilities for isolating system-dependent functions to ease
platform portability.  It provides services to represent a particular machine's
characteristics and to organize these into processor lists and layouts to
allow for optimal allocation of resources to an ESMF component. Also provided
is a unified interface for system-dependent communication services such as
MPI or pthreads. 

ESMF Configuration Management is based on NASA DAO's Inpak package, a collection of routines for accessing files containing
input parameters stored in an ASCII format.
