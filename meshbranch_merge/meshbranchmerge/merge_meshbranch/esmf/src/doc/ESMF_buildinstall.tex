\subsection{Install Options}
\label{BuildOptions}

There is an install target which will copy the library and *.mod files to
specified directories.  To invoke this target use:
\begin{verbatim}
  gmake ESMF_BOPT=[O,g] ESMF_LIB_INSTALL=<path for library>
                   ESMF_MOD_INSTALL=<path for *.mod files> install 
\end{verbatim}

Some users may wish for the library to be built in a directory different from 
where the source code resides.  To do this, build using:
\begin{verbatim}
   gmake ESMF_BUILD=<path> 
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt ESMF\_BUILD} variable gives an alternate path in which to
place the libraries, *.mod files and object files.  This variable
defaults to {\tt ESMF\_DIR}.  If it is assigned another value, the
{\tt ESMF\_BUILD} variable will need to be passed as an additional
argument to the the above make commands.  (Alternatively the variable
{\tt ESMF\_BUILD} can be set in the environment (using setenv or
export) and then it need not be passed to any make calls).
