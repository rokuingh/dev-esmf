\req{Time intervals}
\label{req:tp_tv}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\sreq{Specifying time intervals}
\label{req:spec-tint}
Time intervals specified by the user shall be represented at the interface by the 
sum of some subset of the quantities {\bf D, S and S\_nd, MS, NS, d, m, s, ms, ns}
together with an optional sign.  Shortcut interfaces that provide for the following 
interval representations: {\bf S; D+S; s} are required.  

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} WRF uses {\bf S} to specify timesteps and will use {\bf S\_nd}; \\
CAM-EUL, CAM-FV, FMS codes use a {\bf D+S} representation for time intervals; 
NSIPP, HIM and MITgcm use {\bf s}; 
POP, CICE require all but {\bf S\_nd, NS, m, ms};
NCEP requires signed {\bf s, h} and {\bf D+H+M+S+MS};
WRF and GFDL desire {\bf S\_nd} for model enhancement \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1 for all except {\bf S\_nd}; 
approved-2 for {\bf S\_nd}.\\
{\bf Verification:} Interface inspection, unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Methods that require time interval specification can be designed with 
a generic interface.  Such an interface would allow the user to select the subset of
time specifiers included in the argument list.  This would satisfy the needs of 
target codes and would also allow the interface to be extended to include other 
time units.  The generic interface would be implemented in F90 using named optional 
arguments.  The same approach is suggested for time instants. 
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Time intervals as return values}
\label{sec:query-tinterval}
It shall be possible to return the value of a time interval in a variety of 
representations.  These shall include the combinations listed in \ref{sec:spec-tint}
plus {\bf d, h, m, s, ms}. For returned time periods, the value of each time quantity, 
such as {\bf S}, is bounded by the next larger quantity in the representation.  For 
example, for a {\bf D+S} representation under a Gregorian calendar, the value {\bf S} that is 
returned will be such that {\bf S} $<=$ 86399 (the length of a Gregorian calendar day in
seconds).

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Resolution}

\req{Time instants}
\label{req:time_instants}
\label{req:ti}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Units and representation} 
Time instants specified by the user shall be represented at the interface by the

d,h,m,s} 
and the calendar type.  Shortcut interfaces shall be provided for the following time

{\bf Source:} NSIPP, HIM, MITgcm require {\bf s}; 
CAM-EUL and CAM-FV require {\bf YR+MM+DD+S};

POP, CICE require {\bf YR+MM+DD+HH+M+S, d, s}; \\
WRF requires {\bf YR+MM+DD+H+M+S, YR+MM+DD+H+M+S\_nd} \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Interface inspection, unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} The ranges of the date components {\bf YR, MM, DD} are
calendar specific.  The ranges of the time of day components {\bf M, s} are
not constrained to be between 0 and 60.  It is, for example, possible to
express the time of day using the {\bf s} component only.  
\end{reqlist}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Consistency with time interval}
Time resolution of a time instant must be consistent with that of a time interval.
Consistency is defined in the following way:  the result of incrementing/decrementing 
any representable time instant by any representable time interval must be a representable 
time instant, assuming it lies within the valid range of the calendar.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} All applications require this basic constraint.\\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Interface inspection, unit test. 
\end{reqlist}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Supported calendars}
\label{req:calendar}

\ssreq{Gregorian calendar}
Time instants may use the Gregorian calendar and UTC times.  The required 
range of dates is as wide as possible, but certainly not less than 10,000 years.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1.\\
{\bf Source:} Required for NSIPP, CAM-FV, CAM-EUL, POP, CICE, MITgcm, WRF. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Interface inspection, unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} The available range of Gregorian dates using the standard 
Fliegel et al.\cite{Fli68} algorithm is from November 24, -4713 onward.
Support for leap seconds is {\bf not} required.
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{No-leap calendar}
Time instants may use a no-leap year calendar which is the same as the Gregorian
except that it does not include leap year corrections.  
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2. \\
{\bf Source:} Required for CAM-EUL, GFDL, POP, CICE, MITgcm. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Interface inspection, unit test. 
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Julian calendar}
Full Julian calendar support is required.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2. \\
{\bf Source:} Required for GFDL, NSIPP. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Interface inspection, unit test. 
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{360-day and generic calendar}
\label{req:gencal}
The \funcname should provide support for a generic calendar.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required for GFDL, POP, CICE, MITgcm, desired for NSIPP.  \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Interface inspection, unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:}
Often it is useful to perform an idealized simulation with a calendar
that is an approximation to an actual calendar. A commonly used
configuration is a 360 day year containing 12 months of 30 days each.
Each day is exactly 86400 seconds. The period of rotation is
assumed to be exactly one day and the orbital period around the Sun
is assumed to be exactly one year.
These settings are a useful approximation for the Earth. However, for other
planets, or for idealized parameter space exploration experiments, the year 
length and day length need to be adjusted. A generic calendar may be
specified by the number of days in each month of the year or by 
the length of the year, and the day
length.  The year length need not be an integer
number of days, for example on Venus a year would be 0.926 days.
The range of the year number for generic calendars is -200,000 to
200,000.
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{No calendar option}
Time instants may use a ``no calendar'' option.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 3. \\
{\bf Source:} May be useful for CAM-EUL and MITgcm, WRF. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-2. \\
{\bf Verification:} Interface inspection, unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:}  It is possible to achieve this capability by ignoring the year in 
\ref{req:gencal}.  The {\bf YR} and {\bf MM} components of a time instant
are ignored under the ``no calendar'' option.  The range of the day number,
{\bf DD}, will be at least the number of days in 200,000 years.

\ssreq{Reverse mode}
Following the initialization of a clock and a set of associated alarms, to be able to "reverse" the time-stepping direction anytime after the first {\tt ESMF\_ClockAdvance()} call.

\req{Accuracy of calculations}
\label{req:precision}
Accuracy of calculations with time instants and time intervals.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Exact increment and decrement}
Incrementing or decrementing time instants by exact time intervals is exact.
By exact incrementing of time instants by time intervals we mean the following.
Given a time instant $\tau_{init}$ and a time interval $i_{1}$,
incrementing $\tau_{init}$ by $i_{1}$ $N$ successive times gives the same
result as incrementing $\tau_{init}$ by an interval $i_{N}$ where $i_{N}$
is the result of incrementing $i_{1}$ by $i_{1}$, $(N-1)$ times.  Exact
decrementing is defined analogously.

\sreq{Exact interval calculation}
Calculating the interval between exact time instants is exact.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} \\
{\bf Source:} Required for CAM-FV, GFDL, NSIPP, CAM-EUL, desired for MITgcm, WRF. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} 
Given time instants $\tau_{init}$ and $\tau_{final}$, then the calculated
difference between these instants, $i_{1}$, has the property that 
incrementing $\tau_{init}$ by $i_{1}$ gives $\tau_{final}$.
\end{reqlist}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Exact subdivision}
Exact division of time intervals into an integral number of subintervals.

To ensure a drift free clock the following behavior must be true:

if adding (or subtracting) a time interval, $i_{1}$, to a time 
instant $\tau_{init}$ yields a new time instant $\tau_{final}$ i.e.

$\tau_{final}=\tau_{init}+i_1 $

then it must be possible to specify a fractional time 
interval $i_{2} = \frac{1}{2}\times i_{1}$ such that

$\tau_{final}=\tau_{init}+i_1\equiv\tau_{init}+i_2+i_2 $

and similarly for $i_{3} = \frac{1}{3}\times i_{1}$, $i_{n,m} = \frac{n}{m}\times i_{1}$.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} \\
{\bf Source:} Desired for CAM-FV, GFDL, MITgcm, WRF. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-2. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\  
{\bf Notes:}Such behavior is not possible with finite-precision floating
point arithmetic.  The fractional second part of both time instants and
time intervals must be able to exactly represent rational values.  If
partial seconds represented as rational numbers is supported, then the
precision of time intervals and time instances must be $1/N$ seconds where
$N$ is the largest value of the denominator.  Thus an {\bf \_nd} representation
is required to fully support this.
\end{reqlist}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Floating point accuracy consistent with time step}
Clock accuracy comparable with numerical scheme accuracy should be supported.
Applications that employ an adaptive time-step for their numerical
procedures need to be able to drive their time manager clocks with that step.
This should be possible even for application time steps that are arbitrary 
floating point numbers i.e. not a whole number of seconds, or minutes.

\req{Cross-component clock and alarm queries}
\label{req:sharing}.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Cross-component query}
Components should be able to query the clock(s) or alarms of another
component and components should be able to manipulate certain clock(s) 
and alarms of another component.

{\bf Notes:}
Synchronized shutdown notifications will be sent to components through clock
and alarm settings. These notifications may be generated by a high-level control program
or a coupler component. However, components should be able to determine 
which clocks and alarms can be externally manipulated so that they can assume that
certain clocks and alarms are private.

\sreq{Clock and alarm labels}
Components should be able to "label" their clocks and alarms.
\begin{reqlist}

{\bf Status:} Approved-2. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:}
When coordinating notions of time among components with several
clocks or alarms, it is important to be able to identify the role of 
each clock or alarm.
For instance, a component might want to declare a master clock that 
defines the overall time within a component, or components
might need to declare a standard alarm that can be used
by a higher-level driver layer or a coupler component to trigger 
the generation of restart information or to trigger a clean shutdown.
