%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Adding Arrays to an existing ArrayBundle is currently not supported. In
the future this functionality will be provided via the
{\tt ESMF\_ArrayBundleAdd()} method.
\item The current implementation of the ArrayBundle communication methods only
support ArrayBundles that contain congruent Arrays of the same type, kind and
rank. Congruent Arrays are defined on matching DistGrids and the shape of the
DE-local tiles matches for each DE.
\item The current implementation of the ArrayBundle communication methods have
not been optimized for performance or memory usage.
\end{itemize}
