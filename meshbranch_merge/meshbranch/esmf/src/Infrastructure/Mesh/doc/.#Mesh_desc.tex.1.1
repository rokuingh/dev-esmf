Unstructured grids are commonly used in the computational solution of Partial Differential equations.  The are especially useful for problems that involve complex geometry, where a structured approach
would suffer from over-prescription of resources to cells where no computation is performed.  Finite
element and finite volume methods map naturally to these representations and are used commonly
in hydrology, ocean modeling, and many other applications.

In order to provide general regridding capability for unstructured $\leftrightarrow$ unstructured,
and unstructured $\leftrightarrow$ structured grids, the ESMF library provides a representation of the topology, fields, and interpolation routines for a general unstructured grid.  A simple array based API allows a code to create a mesh, which can then be used to generate weight matrices for these types of regridding scenarios.
