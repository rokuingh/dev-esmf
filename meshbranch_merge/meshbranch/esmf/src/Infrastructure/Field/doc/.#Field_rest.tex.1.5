%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf No mathematical operators.}  The Fields class does not 
currently support advanced
operations on fields, such as differential or other
mathematical operators.

\item {\bf No vector Fields.}  ESMF does not currently  support storage of 
multiple vector Field components in the same Field component, although
that support is planned.  At this time users need to create a 
separate Field object to represent each vector component.

\end{enumerate}
