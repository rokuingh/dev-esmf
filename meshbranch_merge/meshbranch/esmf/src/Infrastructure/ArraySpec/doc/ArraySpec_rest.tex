%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Limit on rank.}  The values for type, kind and rank passed 
into the ArraySpec
class are subject to the same limitations as Arrays.  The maximum
array rank is 7, which is the highest rank supported by Fortran.

\end{enumerate}
