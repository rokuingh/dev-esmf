An ArraySpec is a very simple class that contains type, kind, and
rank information about an array.  This information is stored in two
parameters.  {\bf TypeKind} describes the data type of the elements
in the array and their precision.  {\bf Rank} is the number of dimensions
in the array.

The only methods that are associated with the ArraySpec class are those 
that allow you to set and retrieve this information.
