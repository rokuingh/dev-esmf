%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Fortran array pointer {\tt farrayPtr} obtainable from
{\tt ESMF\_ArrayGet()} is not suitable to be used in Fortran {\tt deallocate()}
calls. Dealocation of user allocated Fortran arrays must use the appropriate variable returned by the Fortran {\tt allocate()} expression.
\item Non-blocking communication, PET-based and DE-based, has not been formulated or implemented.
\end{itemize}
