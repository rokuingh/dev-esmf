%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\label{Array:rest}

\item {\bf CAUTION:} It depends on the specific entry point of {\tt ESMF\_ArrayCreate()} used during Array creation, which Fortran operations are supported on the Fortran array pointer {\tt farrayPtr}, returned by {\tt ESMF\_ArrayGet()}. Only if the {\tt ESMF\_ArrayCreate()} {\em from pointer} variant was used, will the returned {\tt farrayPtr} variable contain the original bounds information, and be suitable for the Fortran {\tt deallocate()} call. This limitation is a direct consequence of the Fortran 95 standard relating to the passing of array arguments.

\item {\bf 1D limit:} ArrayRedist() and ArraySMM() operations on Arrays based on DistGrids with arbitrary sequence indices are currently limited to 1D arbitrary DistGrids.

\end{itemize}
