%\subsection{Use and Examples}

The IOSpec can be used in two ways.  The first way an IOSpec can 
be used is by passing it into the creation method of a data class 
such as a Field or FieldBundle.  This sets a default IOSpec for the 
data object.  Any IO method that involves the data object will 
use the settings in the default IOSpec, as long as there is no 
other IO specification that overrides it.  This brings us to the 
second way to use an IOSpec.  This is not implemented for all data
classes throughout ESMF yet; only Fields can write out data.

The second mode of usage is to pass an IOSpec into a particular 
IO method, such as an {\tt ESMF\_FieldWrite()} call.  The IOSpec 
passed into a write or read call overrides any default settings 
that were set up at data object creation.
