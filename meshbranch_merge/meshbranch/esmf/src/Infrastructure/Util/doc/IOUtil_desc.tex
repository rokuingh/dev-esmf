The ESMF Fortran I/O utilities provide portable methods to access
capabilities which are often implemented in different
ways amongst different environments.  Currently, two utility
methods are implemented: {\tt ESMF\_IOUnitGet()}, to find an unopened
unit number within the range of unit numbers that ESMF
is allowed to use, and {\tt ESMF\_IOUnitFlush()} to flush the
I/O buffer associated with a specific Fortran unit.
