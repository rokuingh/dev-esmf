The BaseTime class is not intended for users; it is only used internally
as a base class for TimeInterval and Time.  The C++ definition for
Time is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
class ESMCI::Time*: public ESMC_BaseTime   // <== inherits base class
{
  private:
    ESMC_Calendar *Calendar;    // associated calendar
    int Timezone;               // Offset from GMT
};
\end{verbatim}
