\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Alarm list allocation factor}  The alarm list within a clock is
dynamically allocated automatically, 200 alarm references at a time.
This constant is defined in both Fortran and C++ with a \#define for ease
of modification.

\item {\bf Sticky alarm end times in reverse}  For sticky alarms, there is
an implicit limitation that in order to properly reverse timestep through a
ring end time, that time must have already been traversed in the forward
direction.  This is due to the fact that the Time Manager cannot predict
when user code will call {\tt ESMF\_AlarmRingerOff()}.  An error message
will be logged when this limitation is not satisfied.

\item {\bf Sticky alarm ring interval in reverse}  For repeating sticky alarms,
it is currently assumed that the ringInterval is constant, so that only the
time of the last call to {\tt ESMF\_AlarmRingerOff()} is saved.  In
{\tt ESMF\_MODE\_REVERSE}, this information is used to turn sticky alarms
back on.  In a future release, ringIntervals will be allowed to be variable,
by saving alarm state at every timestep.

\end{enumerate}
