The Clock class has one parameter limiting the number of alarms that can be
associated with it.  In both F90 and C++ this is

        \#define MAX\_ALARMS 20

If needed, and the non-dynamic memory requirement is lifted, this could be
changed in a future release to a dynamic value passed in during run-time
initialization.
