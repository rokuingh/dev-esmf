\subsubsection{ESMF\_PackFlag}

\label{opt:packflag}
{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}
Specifies whether a FieldBundle is packed or not.  A packed 
FieldBundle contains an array in which all the data in its 
constituent Fields is packed contiguously.  FieldBundles that
are not packed are not guaranteed to carry a contiguous 
array of their data.  This flag is not yet implemented;
the value is always set to {\tt ESMF\_NO\_PACKED\_DATA}.

Valid values are:
\begin{description}
   \item [ESMF\_PACKED\_DATA] 
         Contains a packed array.
   \item [ESMF\_NO\_PACKED\_DATA]
         Does not contain a packed array.
\end{description}
